            Training is one of the most important things in life because it reveals whether a person is a hard worker. It doesn’t matter how you look in the gym as a beginner, what matters is that you show up every single day and prove to yourself—and yes, to others too—that you’re not lazy. You might wonder, “Why should I care about what others think?” Well, because no one wants to work with a lazy person. You can often tell just by looking at someone’s body whether they’re diligent or not.
            <br><br>
            Training is one of the most important commitments I have. I see it as a job because it has the potential to make you rich—believe me. It’s all about showing up every day so that you don’t fall into laziness, because laziness can destroy you.
            <br><br>
            I train seven times a week, and the only time I might take a rest day is when my body is in 100% pain everywhere. And it doesn’t matter if it’s the gym or any other activity, if you have something you love and give 100% every day, that’s what really matters.
            <br><br>
            I truly believe that going to the gym can solve 70% of your problems. The rest is up to you to fix.

            BELOW you can see videos of me doing a 180kg deadlift and a 115kg bench press at the age of 21. And I was always the skinny guy—I used to weigh 50kg.
            <br>
            But I’m telling you, SET SOME GOALS AND SHOOT FOR THEM!
