          <p>	
            Over the past two years, I’ve started playing chess, and I’ve really fallen in love with the game. It’s intense—like a battle between two people, but fought mentally rather than physically. There’s no luck involved in chess, and that’s exactly why I like it. Every move you make on the chessboard leads to a certain outcome, and if your opponent starts taking your pieces, it’s because you made a mistake somewhere along the way.
            <br><br>
            Chess has taught me that if I ever lose a game, it’s entirely on me. I don’t make excuses or blame others. I take full responsibility and make sure I learn from the mistakes I made on the chessboard.
            <br><br>
            I believe in going back and analyzing every game—just like in life. Take a few steps back, look at your mistakes, and find a solution on how you could do better. Or better yet, figure out the best move that could have been made.
            <br><br>
            Chess improves essential skills like decision-making, problem-solving, and quick thinking. It also enhances memory capacity, making it a powerful tool for personal growth. This game isn’t just a pastime—it’s a way to become a better, sharper version of yourself.
